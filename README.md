# üß© VS Code Git Worktrees

A **wrapper for Git Worktree operations** that provides an **interactive API** so developers can manage worktrees more easily ‚Äî without switching between the terminal and VS Code.

## üéØ Purpose of the Extension

After creating a [ZSH plugin for Git operations](https://github.com/alexiszamanidis/zsh-git-fzf), I noticed how often I switched between the terminal and my main editor (VS Code). To streamline my workflow, I built this extension to **keep everything inside VS Code**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

-   **Git ‚â• 2.34.1**

## üß™ Multiple Workspaces Support

This extension supports **multiple workspaces**. Here's how it works:

-   If you have more than one project open, you'll be prompted to choose the workspace to run the operation in.
-   If only one project is open, it is automatically selected.

‚úÖ Select a workspace from the list ‚Üí the operation will run in that workspace.

## üõ†Ô∏è Supported Operations

### ‚ûï `git worktree add [remote-branch] [new-branch]`

Create a new worktree.

**Behavior:**

-   If you skip the new branch name (`ESC`), it defaults to using the same name as the remote branch.
-   Since worktree and branch names are often identical, the extension validates user input accordingly.
    üëâ [See Issue #22](https://github.com/alexiszamanidis/vscode-git-worktrees/issues/22)

### üìÑ `git worktree list`

Display all worktrees and **switch between them easily** via an interactive UI.

### ‚ùå `git worktree remove [worktree-name]`

Remove an existing worktree.

**Behavior:**

-   If untracked or modified files exist, a ‚ö†Ô∏è **popup will appear** in the bottom left.
-   You can **force delete** by clicking the `Force delete` button in that popup.

**Restrictions:**

-   You **cannot delete** the worktree you're currently working in.

# Compile the code and watch for changes
yarn watch
```

Then, open the project in Visual Studio Code, press F5, and it will launch in a new Extension Development Host window.

When you make changes to the extension code, you‚Äôll need to restart the Extension Development Host window for the changes to take effect. You can do this by:

- Clicking the üîÅ Restart button in the top menu bar of the main VS Code window, or
- Pressing the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+F5 on macOS)

**Logs**

You can also enable detailed logging by following these steps before running:
1. Add the following to your user or workspace settings:
```json
"vsCodeGitWorktrees.log.level": "debug"
```
2. Restart VS Code to apply the setting change.
3. Run the extension as described above.

When running locally this way, logs will appear in the **Debug Console**, helping you trace the extension‚Äôs behavior in real time.
