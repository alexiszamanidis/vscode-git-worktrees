# 🧩 VS Code Git Worktrees

A **wrapper for Git Worktree operations** that provides an **interactive API** so developers can manage worktrees more easily — without switching between the terminal and VS Code.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Extension

After creating a [ZSH plugin for Git operations](https://github.com/alexiszamanidis/zsh-git-fzf), I noticed how often I switched between the terminal and my main editor (VS Code). To streamline my workflow, I built this extension to **keep everything inside VS Code**.

## ⚙️ Requirements

-   **Git ≥ 2.34.1**

## 🧪 Multiple Workspaces Support

This extension supports **multiple workspaces**. Here's how it works:

-   If you have more than one project open, you'll be prompted to choose the workspace to run the operation in.
-   If only one project is open, it is automatically selected.

✅ Select a workspace from the list → the operation will run in that workspace.

## 🛠️ Supported Operations

### ➕ `git worktree add [remote-branch] [new-branch]`

Create a new worktree.

**Behavior:**

-   If you skip the new branch name (`ESC`), it defaults to using the same name as the remote branch.
-   Since worktree and branch names are often identical, the extension validates user input accordingly.
    👉 [See Issue #22](https://github.com/alexiszamanidis/vscode-git-worktrees/issues/22)

### 📄 `git worktree list`

Display all worktrees and **switch between them easily** via an interactive UI.

### ❌ `git worktree remove [worktree-name]`

Remove an existing worktree.

**Behavior:**

-   If untracked or modified files exist, a ⚠️ **popup will appear** in the bottom left.
-   You can **force delete** by clicking the `Force delete` button in that popup.

**Restrictions:**

-   You **cannot delete** the worktree you're currently working in.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. 📦 Install the [Git Worktrees](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitWorktrees.git-worktrees) extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. 💡 Open the command palette: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
3. 🔍 Search for any available operations
    > All commands are prefixed with: `Git Worktree: `
