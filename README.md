# git-worktrees

A VS Code extension that wraps git worktree operations for simplicity and productivity

### Purpose of the extension

After creating a ZSH plugin that was responsible for wrapping up my daily git operations([zsh-git-fzf](https://github.com/alexiszamanidis/zsh-git-fzf)), I found myself very often switching between the terminal and my main Editor(VS Code). So I decided to create an extension for my main Editor that would help me avoid switching between them and keep everything in one tool.

### Supported operations

-   `git worktree list`

    Display all worktrees and switch between them
