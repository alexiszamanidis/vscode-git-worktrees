# Git Worktrees

A Wrapper for Git Worktree Operations that provides an interactive API so developers can have a better experience.

### Purpose of the extension

After creating a ZSH plugin that was responsible for wrapping up my daily git operations([zsh-git-fzf](https://github.com/alexiszamanidis/zsh-git-fzf)), I found myself very often switching between the terminal and my main Editor(VS Code). So I decided to create an extension for my main Editor that would help me avoid switching between them and keep everything in one tool.

### Purpose of the extension

-   Git version: 2.34.1

### Supported operations

-   `git worktree list`

    Display all worktrees and switch between them

-   `git worktree remove [worktree-name]`

    Remove a worktree

    **Behavior**

    -   If the worktree you want to delete is the same as the one you are currently working on, then you will be moved to another directory:
        -   If there are no other worktrees, you will be moved to the parent directory
        -   Otherwise, it will search for **main worktrees** like: `["master", "main", "develop", "dev", "release"]`, so you can be moved to them.
            -   If it **doesn't find any main worktree**, you will be moved to the first directory selected by `git worktree list`

### Getting started

**Steps:**

-   Install [Git Worktree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitWorktrees.git-worktrees) VS Code extension
-   Open the palette: `CTRL + SHIFT + P`
-   Search for any avaiable operations
    -   Prefix: `Git Worktree: `
