# Git Worktrees

A Wrapper for Git Worktree Operations that provides an interactive API so developers can have a better experience.

### Purpose of the extension

After creating a ZSH plugin that was responsible for wrapping up my daily git operations([zsh-git-fzf](https://github.com/alexiszamanidis/zsh-git-fzf)), I found myself very often switching between the terminal and my main Editor(VS Code). So I decided to create an extension for my main Editor that would help me avoid switching between them and keep everything in one tool.

### Requirements

-   Git version: 2.34.1

### Supported operations

-   `git worktree add [new-branch] [remote-branch]`

    Create a new worktree

    **Behavior**

    -   If you do not select a remote branch(`ESC`), you will create a new worktree with the new branch you typed. This was made for convenience, instead of having `git worktree add master master`, you can just run `git worktree add master`.

-   `git worktree list`

    Display all worktrees and switch between them

-   `git worktree remove [worktree-name]`

    Remove a worktree

    **Restrictions**

    -   You cannot delete the same Worktree as the one you are currently working on

### Getting started

**Steps:**

-   Install [Git Worktree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitWorktrees.git-worktrees) VS Code extension
-   Open the palette: `CTRL + SHIFT + P`
-   Search for any available operations
    -   Prefix: `Git Worktree: `
