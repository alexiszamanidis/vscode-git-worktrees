# Git Worktrees

A Wrapper for Git Worktree Operations that provides an interactive API so developers have a better experience.

### Purpose of the extension

After creating a ZSH plugin that was responsible for wrapping up my daily git operations([zsh-git-fzf](https://github.com/alexiszamanidis/zsh-git-fzf)), I found myself very often switching between the terminal and my main Editor(VS Code). So I decided to create an extension for my main Editor that would help me avoid switching between them and keep everything in one tool.

### Supported operations

-   `git worktree list`

    Display all worktrees and switch between them

-   `git worktree remove [worktree-name]`

    Remove a worktree

### Getting started

**Steps:**

-   Install [Git Worktree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitWorktrees.git-worktrees) VS Code extension
-   Open the palette: `CTRL + SHIFT + P`
-   Search for any avaiable operations
    -   Prefix: `Git Worktree: `

### Features/Operations
